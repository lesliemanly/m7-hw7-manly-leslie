##I had an issue with getting an object inside of an object in the main section. I e-mailed you about it, but was able to figure it out all on my own by going back in to dev tools and looking at the apiResult and talking myself through it, like you recommend doing. I was then able to figure it out on my own and I am super proud of myself!

###I did use 3 different resources to help me with this assignment.
I used this link to help me with the blinking text in my footer https://html-online.com/articles/blinking-text-css-animation/

I used this website to assist me with hex codes for the color of my page https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/html-color-codes.html
